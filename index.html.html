       <br>CSS fundamentals explains everything you'll need to get started.</p>
   
    <h2 style="color: indigo;">What is CSS?</h2>
      <p id="par-2">CSS is not a programming language like HTML.
           <br>It's also not a markup language. 
           CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. 
           <br>CSS is used to style HTML elements selectively.
            This CSS, for example, selects paragraph text and changes the font style. 
            <br>In order for CSS to adequately apply to an HTML content it has to be linked using the link tag

      <h2 style="color: rgb(4, 65, 24);">Anatomy of a CSS Element</h2>
      <p id="par-3">A ruleset is the name given to the entire structure. </p> <br>
      <img src="css-declaration-small.png" height="50%" width="50%">
     
      <p>The main parts of the CSS element are as follows</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Selector - 
          This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. 
          <br>It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, &lt;p&gt; elements). To style a different element, change the selector.</li>
        <li>Declaration -
          This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.</li>
        <li>Properties - An HTML element can be styled in a variety of ways. <br>(Color is a property of the &lt;p&gt; elements in this example.) 
          <br>In CSS, you select the attributes you want the rule to influence.</li>
        <li>Property Value - The property value is listed to the right of the property, following the colon. 
          <br>This selects one of the many potential appearances for a given property from a large number of options. 
          <br>(There are numerous color values other than red, for example.)</li>
       </ul>

       <h2 style="color: rgb(7, 47, 85);">Summary</h2>
       <p>The code that styles online content is called CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). 
         <br>CSS is not a programming language in the same way that HTML is not. 
         <br>Not only is it not a markup language, but it is also not a programming language.</p>
         
         <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a programming language that allows you to create style sheets. <br>CSS is the method for styling HTML elements selectively.
          <br>Selector, Declaration, Properties, and Property Value are all part of a ruleset.</p>
